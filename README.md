# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data. The goal is to understand how the virus spread across the globe, how countries responded, and what insights can be drawn from trends in cases, deaths, testing, and other health indicators.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Analyze COVID-19 cases, deaths, and testing data globally.
- Clean and preprocess raw datasets for accurate analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
- Visualize data through clear and informative plots.
- Compare country-level and continent-level COVID-19 responses.
- Generate insights based on statistical summaries and visual findings.

## ðŸ“Š What We Did

### âœ… Data Collection

We used a publicly available dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), which includes:

- Daily confirmed cases
- Death counts
- Testing rates
- Vaccination statistics
- Demographic and healthcare metrics

### âœ… Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Removed unnecessary columns.
- Handled missing and inconsistent values.
- Converted date strings to datetime objects.
- Aggregated and grouped data by country and continent.

### âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Trend analysis of daily and cumulative cases and deaths.
- Identification of peak periods and wave patterns.
- Comparison of COVID-19 trends by country/continent.
- Analysis of death rates vs. testing and vaccination levels.
- Correlation between population density, GDP, hospital beds, etc., with COVID-19 outcomes.

### âœ… Data Visualization

We used `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to create:

- Line charts of daily new cases and deaths.
- Bar plots comparing top affected countries.
- Heatmaps showing correlation between features.
- Histograms and boxplots for distribution analysis.
